## *With Useful Diagrams for Camber, Shock Angle, and Offset*

## **1. What Is Camber and Why Does It Matter in RC Drifting?**

### **Camber Explained**

Camber is the angle of the wheel when viewed from the front of the car.

```
Positive Camber          Neutral Camber            Negative Camber
     \                         |                         /
      \                        |                        /
       \                       |                       /
```

### **Recommended for RC Drift**

* **Front:** –2° to –5°
* **Rear:** –1° to –3°

### **Why?**

* **More negative camber (front)** → better mid-drift grip & steering control
* **Too much** → tire wears unevenly & grip drops

---

## **2. What Is Shock Angle and How Does It Affect Handling?**

### **Shock Mounting Angle (Side View)**

```
Vertical Shock (More Grip)
    |
    |
    |
---O----

Angled Shock (Less Grip / Softer Response)
   \
    \
     \
---O----
```

### **General Rules**

* **More vertical** → stiffer response, more traction
* **More angled** → softer, smoother transitions

### **Recommended for Drift**

* **Front shocks:** Slightly angled (smooth steering response)
* **Rear shocks:** More vertical (stability while sliding)

---

## **3. What Shock Oil Weight Should I Use?**

Shock oil controls how fast the suspension compresses and rebounds.

### **Common Silicone Oil Weights**

* **200cSt – 350cSt:** soft, smoother drift, good for beginners
* **400cSt – 600cSt:** balanced, most common for drift
* **700cSt – 1000cSt:** very stiff, used for competition tuning

### **Recommended Baseline**

* **Front:** 350cSt – 500cSt
* **Rear:** 450cSt – 600cSt

**Tip:**
Thicker oil helps maintain stability during high-angle drifts.

---

## **4. What Is Wheel Offset and How Does It Affect Drift?**

Wheel offset determines how far the wheels sit from the hub.
It affects track width, steering angle, and wheel fitment.

### **Offset Diagram**

```
Hub          0mm Offset Wheel
|----|   [   Wheel   ]

Hub        +6mm Offset Wheel (Wider Track)
|----|       [      Wheel      ]
```

### **Effects**

* **Higher Offset (e.g., +6 / +8 / +10)**

  * Wider stance
  * More steering clearance
  * More stability

* **Lower Offset (e.g., +0 / +3)**

  * Wheels closer to chassis
  * May rub during high angle
  * Narrower track, easier to rotate

### **Recommended for Drift**

* **Front:** +6mm to +8mm
* **Rear:** +3mm to +6mm

---

## **5. How Should I Set Ride Height for Best Drifting Performance?**

Ride height influences weight transfer and stability.

### **Recommendations**

* **Front:** 5–7mm
* **Rear:** 6–8mm (slightly higher for better drift rotation)

Lower = more stable, but too low causes chassis scraping.

---

## **6. What Tire Hardness Works Best for Drifting?**

Tire choice dramatically affects drift smoothness.

### **Types**

* **Hard Drift Tires:** Longer slides, stable, good for polished floors
* **Medium Tires:** Most common for asphalt / concrete
* **Soft Tires:** More grip, easier for beginners

### **Recommended Hardness**

* **45–55 Shore** → balanced for most surfaces
* **60+ Shore** → smooth floors & carpet tracks

---

## **7. How Do Toe Angles Affect Drift?**

### **Toe Diagram (Top View)**

```
Toe-In (More Stability)
\       /
 \     /
  \   /

Toe-Out (More Steering Response)
/   \
 /     \
/       \
```

### **Recommended**

* **Front:** 0° to slight toe-out (better initial turn-in)
* **Rear:** 1° to 2° toe-in (keeps rear stable during drift)

---

## **8. What’s the Best Beginner-Friendly Drift Setup?**

Here is a complete baseline to help new players instantly improve:

### **Suspension**

* **Front camber:** –4°
* **Rear camber:** –2°
* **Front toe:** 0° ~ slight toe-out
* **Rear toe:** 2° toe-in
* **Shock angle:**

  * Front: mild angle
  * Rear: more vertical
* **Shock oil:**

  * Front: 400cSt
  * Rear: 500cSt

### **Wheels & Tires**

* **Offset:**

  * Front: +6mm
  * Rear: +3mm
* **Tire hardness:** 45–55 Shore

### **Ride Height**

* **Front:** 6mm
* **Rear:** 7mm

This setup is tested and proven to give **easy control, strong angle, and stable transitions**.

## **9. Any Extra Tuning Tips for New Drifters?**

✔ If your car **spins too easily** → add rear toe-in or thicker shock oil
✔ If your car **understeers** → more front camber or toe-out
✔ If your car **lacks angle** → increase front offset
✔ If your car **bounces** → reduce oil weight or soften springs
✔ If your car **grips too much** → use harder drift tires
