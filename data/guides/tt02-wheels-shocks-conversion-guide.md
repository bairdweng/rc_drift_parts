# TT02 90mm Wheels + 65mm Shocks Conversion Guide: A Practical Alternative to the TT02B

---

For many Tamiya TT02 owners, turning the chassis into a light off-road or rally machine becomes a tempting upgrade—especially when the TT02B is too expensive or hard to find in certain regions.
One popular approach is running **90mm wheels** together with **65mm shocks** to increase ground clearance and improve rough-surface drivability.

This guide explains what works, what doesn’t, and how to optimize your setup.

# **1. Why 90mm Wheels on a TT02?**


![90mm wheels](/static/images/articles/tt02-wheels-shocks-conversion-guide-image-2.webp)

90mm wheels (rally block or semi-buggy style) offer:

* Increased ground clearance
* Better performance on dirt, gravel, grass
* More suspension travel
* A cheaper alternative to buying a TT02B

For rough-surface use, this is the fastest way to lift the chassis.

---

# **2. Why 65mm Shocks?**


![65mm shocks](/static/images/articles/tt02-wheels-shocks-conversion-guide-image-3.webp)

Stock TT02 touring shocks are roughly **55mm**, while off-road buggy shocks go **65–70mm**.

Why 65mm?

* Adds droop + travel without ruining geometry
* Fits easily on TT02 arms
* Avoids the harsh stiffness of 70mm buggy shocks
* Works perfectly with 90mm wheels

This combination is ideal for “rally / semi-offroad” builds.

# **3. What Changes When You Install 90mm Wheels + 65mm Shocks?**



This upgrade affects:

### **✔ Dogbone angle**

Biggest issue—can pop out at full droop.
**Fix:** droop limiters, universal shafts, or adding spacers.

### **✔ Camber & toe**

Lifted ride height exaggerates camber and toe-out.
**Fix:** adjustable arms + steering links.

### **✔ Steering response**

Bigger wheels = slower steering.
**Fix:** faster servo + reduce front droop.

### **✔ Wheel arch clearance**

May rub body shells.
**Fix:** raise posts or use rally shell.

# **4. TT02 vs TT02B Comparison**


![TT02B comparison](/static/images/articles/tt02-wheels-shocks-conversion-guide-image-4.webp)

| Feature           | TT02 (Modified) | TT02B            |
| ----------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Ground clearance  | ⭐ Good          | ⭐⭐ Better        |
| Suspension travel | ⭐ Good          | ⭐⭐ Better        |
| Dogbone angle     | ⚠ Needs tuning  | ⭐ Optimized      |
| Durability        | ⭐ Decent        | ⭐⭐ Strong        |
| Cost              | ⭐⭐ Cheaper      | ⚠ More expensive |
| Difficulty        | ⭐ Easy          | ⭐ Moderate       |

If TT02B is overpriced in your local market, this conversion is a highly effective alternative.
