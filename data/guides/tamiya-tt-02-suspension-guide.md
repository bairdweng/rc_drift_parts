# **Tamiya TT-02 Suspension Setup Guide**

*Complete drift-specific suspension tuning for your Tamiya TT-02 conversion.*

---

## **TT-02 Specific Suspension Considerations**

The Tamiya TT-02 chassis has unique characteristics that require specific tuning approaches for optimal drifting performance.

### **Stock Suspension Limitations**
- Plastic suspension arms with limited adjustment range
- Basic shock design that benefits from upgrades
- Limited camber and toe adjustment out of the box

### **Recommended Upgrades for Drifting**
1.  **Aluminum suspension arms** - Better precision and durability
2.  **Oil-filled shocks** - Improved damping control
3.  **Adjustable turnbuckles** - Fine-tuned alignment control

---

## **Optimal Drift Settings for TT-02**

### **Camber Settings**
- **Front:** -3° to -4° (more negative for better steering response)
- **Rear:** -1° to -2° (slight negative for stability)

### **Toe Settings**
- **Front:** 0° to slight toe-out (1°-2° for better turn-in)
- **Rear:** 2° toe-in (increased stability during slides)

### **Ride Height**
- **Front:** 6-7mm (slightly lower for better steering response)
- **Rear:** 7-8mm (slightly higher for easier rotation)

---

## **Shock Setup Recommendations**

### **Shock Oil Weights**
- **Front:** 350-400cSt (smoother steering transitions)
- **Rear:** 450-500cSt (stable rear end during drifts)

### **Spring Rates**
- **Front:** Medium soft springs (better weight transfer)
- **Rear:** Medium firm springs (controlled slide behavior)

---

## **Wheel and Tire Setup**

### **Wheel Offset**
- **Front:** +6mm to +8mm (wider track for stability)
- **Rear:** +3mm to +5mm (narrower for easier rotation)

### **Tire Compounds**
- **Hard plastic tires** (45-55 Shore) for most surfaces
- **PVC drift tires** for smooth concrete and polished floors

---

## **Common TT-02 Drift Issues and Solutions**

### **Problem: Understeer in Drifts**
**Solution:** Increase front negative camber, reduce front shock damping

### **Problem: Over-rotation**
**Solution:** Increase rear toe-in, use heavier rear shock oil

### **Problem: Chassis Bottoming Out**
**Solution:** Increase ride height, use stiffer springs

---

## **Advanced TT-02 Drift Modifications**

### **CS (Counter Steer) Ratio Adjustment**
- Stock TT-02 has approximately 1.8:1 CS ratio
- Consider upgrading to adjustable steering arms for better CS tuning

### **Weight Distribution**
- Move battery forward for better front grip
- Add weight to rear for improved slide control

---

## **Maintenance Tips**

- Regularly check suspension arm bushings for wear
- Clean and re-oil shocks every 10-15 runs
- Inspect turnbuckles for thread wear
- Check wheel bearings for smooth operation

---

## **Final Setup Recommendations**

For most TT-02 drift conversions, start with these baseline settings and adjust based on your driving style and track conditions.

### **Beginner-Friendly Setup**
- Front camber: -3°, Rear camber: -1°
- Front toe: 0°, Rear toe: 2°
- Ride height: 7mm front, 8mm rear
- Shock oil: 350cSt front, 450cSt rear

With proper suspension tuning, your Tamiya TT-02 can become a competitive drift machine!
